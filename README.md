# IT-PCs

This software was written to make our work easier in the classrooms.

This software helps us turn off, restart, check pings or re-receive IP on computers.

The software uses a protocol called WinRM and with its help it transmits the commands to the other computers.

The software is built in two stages:
1. Preparation phase (SetUP-ITPCs):
   - At this stage we will run the script on all the computers so that it activates and configures the WinRM protocol on the computers for the software to use.

2. Implementation phase (ITPCs):
   - At this point, after we have prepared all the computers to run the software, we can control the computers remotely.
   - At the moment with the help of the software we can turn off, restart, check pings and get a new IP on the other computers.
   - In the future, the software will have additional options.
